The purpose of this app is to provide a simple notification app whereby it will send periodic notifications throughout the day to aid in memorization.  It will quiz you on the (currently 20) Japanese kanji characters within the deck.  
Ever so often it will send a notification to remind you about what certain kanji are.  If you want to see the answer, just click on the notification and it will show all the resources to know what the kanji definitions and example sentences are.
They say that spatial repetition can really help with memorization so this is something that can play in the background every day, and if I have time for it I can engage, and if not, just swipe away like the many other notifications that come along every day.


Clicking on the jisho.org and Jim Breen buttons will pull up online dictionaries for those specific kanji, and the 10 examples button will pull up 10 example sentences using that kanji.
